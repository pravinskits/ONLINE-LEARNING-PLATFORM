*Description*:

This code sets up a backend server for an online learning platform using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It supports essential features such as user registration and login, video lesson delivery, quizzes, and progress tracking. The server uses bcrypt to securely hash user passwords during registration and JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to authenticate users and protect sensitive routes, such as updating learning progress. It defines three main database models: User, Video, and Quiz, using Mongoose schemas. The /videos endpoint fetches all available lessons, while /quiz/:videoId retrieves quiz questions related to a specific video. Authenticated users can update their learning progress through the /progress route, which requires a valid JWT token. Overall, this code provides a complete backend foundation for a student-friendly learning platform that enables secure access to educational content and tracks user progress effectively.
